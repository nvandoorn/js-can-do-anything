# 2. Stay Motivated

## Goal

Understand the idea of building a front-end app that relies on JS with minimal dependency on the HTML

## Starter

This template implements a grid closely resembling GitHub. It's motivating to see your progress over such a long period of time, so why not track some stuff besides your code habits? This app allows users to track any good habit they wish to form. For example, a users goal may be to exercise everyday. Each day they deliver on this promise will be tracked on the grad.

### Expansion Ideas

- Wire it up to a back-end such that users can save their progress (currently reset on each refresh)
- Allow users to specify and track how much time they spent forming their habit each day
- Allow users to select a custom colour for their grid
