# 3. Realtime Stocks

## Goal

Understand why JS frameworks and tools are so common in production. Showcase of some functional programming techniques.

## Starter

This template demonstrates a basic React app with a single (and fake) source of data. Stock data is updated in near realtime, and the page will update accordingly. I was hoping to get a real stock API to use but most of them are paid unfortunately.

### Expansion Ideas

- Wire it up to a real stock API
- Show a few different stocks
- Let users add search for stocks stock they want
- Support searching stocks
- Allow users to save their state by using a server/database (Firebase would work well)
