# JavaScript Can Do Anything

Seriously ðŸ”¥

Presentation slides are hosted here: [https://vigorous-shannon-49b7f7.netlify.com/](https://vigorous-shannon-49b7f7.netlify.com/)

## Workshop Preparation

Make sure you have Node/npm installed. If not, I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script). After that, install `yarn` using `npm install -g yarn`.

## Demos

All demo code used in the slides to clarify concepts. Can be run and modified directly in this folder. Rebuilding the presentation will import the changes.
